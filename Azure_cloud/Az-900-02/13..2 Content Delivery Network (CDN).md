# 13.2 Content Delivery Network (CDN) 

- What is CDN ?

    It puts stuff like blobs and other static content in a cache(increase the speed of cloud services) on edge servers. The process involves placing the data at strategically chosen locations  and caching it(in point of presence). As a result, it provides maximum bandwidth for its delivery to users.

#### Key Terminologies:

- Point of presence(POP):

Is primarily the infrastructure that allows remote users connect to connect to the Internet. A POP is generally present at an Internet service provider (ISP) or the telecommunication service provider. It can consist of a router, switches, servers and other data communication devices.

- Edge servers:
Edge servers refers to servers (compute resources) that run the processing at an edge location, which can be anywhere along the edge spectrum â€“ usually from on-premises edge to regional edge.

- Edge location:

An edge location is where end users access services located at a cloud provider. They are located in most of the major cities around the world and are specifically used by CDN to distribute content to end users to reduce latency.
            
-   How does CDN / replace CDN in a classic setting?

    -   CDN provides better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are required to load content. In comparison to a classical setting where some VM are located far from end users thus creating high latency. 

    -   How can I combine CDN with other services?


        -   You can integrate an Azure storage account with Azure CDN. Also you can add Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to a web app in Azure App Service. 

    -   What is the difference between CDN and other similar services?

        -  CDN and Web Hosting seem to be similar, but they are totally two different concepts. Web Hosting is hosting your content of your website in a server. There are different hosting plans available these days like shared hosting, VPS (Virtual Private Hosting), Dedicated Hosting and Cloud Hosting. You can also compare it to Cloudfront of AWS.

        -   Mostly, web content are hosted in a single server, but CDN content will be spread across the world, in multiple hosted environment.
