13.4 Azure Files

-   Where can I find this service in the console?
        
    - You can find Azure File share under a tab in your Storage account. See below picture.


        
    -   How do I enable this service?

         -  You can use Azure Files when you have created a Storage account. 
        The storage account is already active, but there is nothing on it. Azure Documentation expalined that, Azure Files is really put into use when I upload a file in it.
        Below I have an example. I have uploaded a file in Azure Files share. 

        ![fileshare](../../00_includes/AZ13-fileshare.png)

        ![fileshareinvmmount](../../00_includes/AZ13-4-Fileshareinvm1.png)

 
        ![filesharevmmount](../../00_includes/AZ13-4fileshareinvm2.png)

        ![fileshareinvmmount](../../00_includes/AZ13-4-fileshareinvm3.png)

      

    -   How can I link this service to other resources?

        -  You can link your file share to different services. You can share the file and connect to your current OS. For example, on-premises machines, which can import and use the files. You can also connect the File share to a VM(see above), which is made accessible via a private endpoint and can then be connected to the location that needs access. The configurations must be fine-tuned, which ensures that the files are available from both endpoints. Finally you can also connect it to the storage account.
