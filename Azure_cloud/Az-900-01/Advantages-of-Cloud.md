# Advantages of the cloud



#### The 6 benefits of the cloud in Azure are: 

1. High Availability;

The availability of data and applications is a core requirement for any application, whether it is on-premises or in the cloud. If your data or application isn’t available to you, nothing else matters. There are many reasons why you may lose availability, but the most common issues are:

- A network outage

- An application failure

- A system, such as a virtual machine, outage

- A power outage

A problem with a reliant system such as an external database

Microsoft Azure offers a service-level agreement (SLA) that guarantees a certain level(99.9) depending on the service, but it only covers systems that are controlled by the cloud provider.


2. Scalability:

Computing resources aren’t free. The best way to minimize cost is to use only the resources necessary for your purposes. The challenge is that resource needs can change often and quickly. So a company can add resource by scaling, this can be both vertical scaling(scale up) by increasing RAM or CPU. Or horizontal scaling (scale out) by adding multiple VM.

3. Elasticity;
The concept of automatically scaling by configuring Auto-Scale. Auto-Scale is an Azure service that can automatically scale applications running in many Azure services based on usage patterns, resource utilization, time of day, and much more.

4. Agility;

Azure allows you to quickly scale.
Azure takes care of allocating the resources for you. All you have to do is tell Azure how many VMs you want and you’re up and running. This kind of speed and flexibility in the cloud is often called cloud agility.

5. Geo-distribution

Microsoft ensures that those  virtual machines(VM) are allocated in a region but in separate availability zones infrastructure so that when the users may require that their data remain in their region. Then you can direct users to the most suitable cloud based on their requirements.

6. Disaster recovery

Microsoft Azure design their infrastructure in such a way as to ensure fault tolerance. For example, from an unhealthy VM to a healthy VM. However, there are times when much larger failures can occur. For example, natural disasters in a region can impact all resources in that particular region. Not only can something like that impact availability, but without a plan in place, disasters can also mean the loss of valuable data.


#### Consumption based model:

That customers only pay when they use resources, as such they have no upfront cost associated. Because of that you can create resources at any time and delete them at any time, so you don’t waste any resources. Once resources are deleted, customers stop paying.

#### These are the 6 benefits of the cloud according AWS:

1. Trade capital expenditure to variable expenditure: Pay only for what you use.

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale.

3. Stop guessing about capacity

4. Increase speed and agility

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

6. Go global in minutes


### Challenges overcame:

Not much because i was familiar with most of the terms from AWS CCP.
