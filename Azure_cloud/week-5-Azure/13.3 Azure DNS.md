3. Azure DNS 

    -   What is Azure DNS for?
     
     Is a cloud service that allows you to host and manage domain name system (DNS) domains, also known as DNS zones. It works like a phonebook, but here is where computers  resolve domain names to IP addresses.
     For example, www.tailwindtraders.com (a host record) mapping to a specific IP address (40.71.177.34).
    

    -   How does Azure DNS / replace Azure DNS in a classic setting?

        - Traditionally when a DNS service is hosted on a server running Windows Server or Linux and a DNS zone gets delegated to that server. But DNS zones in Azure DNS are hosted across Azure's global network of DNS name servers. These servers use Anycast networking so that queries for DNS zone data will be answered by the DNS server closest to the querying client. 

    -   How can I combine Azure DNS with other services?

        - Azure Firewall DNS proxy can be used as DNS forwarder for On-premises workloads and Virtual network workloads using a DNS forwarder.

        - Use Azure DNS for private domains.
