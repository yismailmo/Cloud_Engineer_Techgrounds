2. Content Delivery Network (CDN) 

    - What is CDN ?

    It puts stuff like blobs and other static content in a cache(increase the speed of cloud services) on edge servers. The process involves placing the data at strategically chosen locations  and caching it(in point of presence). As a result, it provides maximum bandwidth for its delivery to users.

    -   How does CDN / replace CDN in a classic setting?

        -   CDN provides better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are required to load content. In comparison to a classical setting where some VM are located far from end users thus creating high latency. 

    -   How can I combine CDN with other services?


        -   You can integrate an Azure storage account with Azure CDN. Also you can add Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to a web app in Azure App Service. 

    -   What is the difference between CDN and other similar services?

        -  CDN and Web Hosting seem to be similar, but they are totally two different concepts. Web Hosting is hosting your content of your website in a server. There are different hosting plans available these days like shared hosting, VPS (Virtual Private Hosting), Dedicated Hosting and Cloud Hosting.

        -   Mostly, web content are hosted in a single server, but CDN content will be spread across the world, in multiple hosted environment.
