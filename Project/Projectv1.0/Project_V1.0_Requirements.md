# Project requirements:


Below is a list of the essential requirements:

1. All VM disks must be encrypted.

2. The web server must be backed up daily. The backups must be kept for 7 days.

3. The web server must be installed in an automated manner.

4. The admin/management server must be reachable with a public IP.

5. The admin/management server should only be reachable from trusted locations (office/admin's home)

6. The following IP ranges are used: 10.10.10.0/24 & 10.20.20.0/24

7. All subnets must be protected by a firewall at the subnet level.

8. SSH or RDP connections to the web server may only be established from the admin server.



Budget given for the entire project is maximum 150 euros.

Deliverables:

- A working app from MVP (Minimum viable product);

The working application must successfully complete a build and deployment.

A version of my MVP should be easy to identifiable with a tag, or a release. In addition, my repository should contain documentation on how to use the application. By indicating how to call the application, the arguments that are needed, and which rights are needed in order to deploy in Azure.

- Design Documentation;

By using the existing architecture(see architecture figure). In this document I will fill in the gaps and finally list the practical and technical information in GitHub. This document will contain information about the chosen (N)SG rules. But also a visualization of what, and in what order, the application deploys in the cloud.

In v1.1 I will also post my own diagrams with the adjustments and point out the improvements.

- Time logs
This file is used to keep track of the day and what obstactles I faced along with the solutions indicated in a single sentence.

Also in this document I will add information about the services that i will be using along with the reasoning for that particular service; It will also contain all my assumptions and improvements.

Final presentation
Status of the project presentations will be my first presentation and on the last friday (26-08-2022) I will present the entire project.
