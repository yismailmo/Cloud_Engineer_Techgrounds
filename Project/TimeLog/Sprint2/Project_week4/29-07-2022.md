Continue with testing v1.0
## Obstakels

Could not connect to the linux vm via adminserver while using the RDP, becuase it was timing out(taking too long to connect)
## Oplossingen

log out and restart again with the deployement of all the resources.

az group delete --name V1AzProject

New-AzResourceGroup -Name V1AzProject -Location "Northeurope"

Also in the peering file, i had to create another resource for the second Vnet(webserver), in this way the peering worked for in both ways for AdminVnet and WebserverVnet.

## Learnings
