- storage account

## Obstakels


## Oplossingen



## Learnings

Got feedback from the Learning coaches(stakeholders in this case) to look into my storage tier choice of 'cool' because of the higher acces costs (also might be charged an early deletion fee if a blob is moved to the Cool tier and then deleted after less than 30 days). Therefore i changed my acces tier to 'Hot'.

On top of that, I was advised to rename the adminserver inorder to differentiate from other vm/vnet (so I changed the vm and vnet to adminVm and adminVnet)
