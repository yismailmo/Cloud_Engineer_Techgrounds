## Obstakels
 
figure out the blob storage and disks to be encrypted for the storage.
 Deciding whether to use a hot tier or cool tier and why.

updated my powershell to 7.0

Decompiling json file to bicep file
## Oplossingen

cool tier is chosen for the storage account because of the Short-term data backup.

managed disk with standard ssd is chosen for the project because it can be used for webservers.

Downloaded the (x86) powershell version

By using the command 'bicep decompile trial(filename).json'
