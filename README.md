# Cloud_Engineer_Techgrounds

This was an intensive fulltime course which helped me to learn and practice the fundamentals needed to be a cloud Engineer.
Topics like:

1.Linux

2.Networking

3.Security

4.Azure 900

5.Infra-as-a-code project with Azure Bicep and Powershell

The Topics above were provided as an exercise, so that I can figure things out on my own. This also gave me the opprotunities to discover and ask for help when I'm stuck.
