# Cloud_Engineer_Techgrounds

This was an intensive 4 months fulltime course which helped me to learn and practice the fundamentals needed to be a cloud Engineer.

The Topics that were covered were given as an exercise, so that I can figure things out on my own. This also gave me the opprotunities to discover and ask for help when I'm stuck.

Besides the exercises, I passed my Az-900 Fundamentals and finally I did a project to setup Infrastructure as a code with Bicep.
