# [Group] Retro of Week [N]
Scrum master: Give everybody 10 minutes to answer the questions stated below. Then allow them to write them down.

Everybody: Use 10 minutes to answer the given questions. Write the answer down.

Afterwards: Place a copy of this filled out form in your repository.

## What went well?
 - Example: We used the pomodoro technique and we were able to get a good overview of the assignments.


There was always someone you can ask a question and they will direct you to the right direction without giving you the answers.

planning was good, eg NT01 was alot of reading and so i can go to the next

Day schedule worked really well

helping eachother.

## What could have gone better?
 - Example: We took a bit too long on our standups and wasted time.
 - 
More team discussion, because we some of us were ahead with the assignments, so it was difficult to discuss each assignment.

more sharing sources,

Standup was not according to the theory

more side ways from discussion

more focussed and not enough time to do my own assignment.

## What can we do to improve?
 - Example: We could use a more efficient way of doing the standups.

use the pomodoro technique or have small break out to discuss what someone got out of the assignment and not wait till the end.

not wait for discuss moment but ask question directly before 11:00 and discuss in 11:00 meeting.

fast doers and slow mover to be more close
