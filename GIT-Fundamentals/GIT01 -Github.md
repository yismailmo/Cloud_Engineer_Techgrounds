## Key terminology

**Repository**
Contains the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file's revision history.

**GitHub** 
Hosts Git repositories and provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. 

**Main / Master**
the default branch can be named  as "master", but "main" is the standard name given to a branch of the repo.

**Branch**
is a  copy of a file that one would like to work on without messing up the original copy(main branch).
