1. Number Guessing:

- Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (or any other range).

- The player guesses a number. For every wrong answer the player receives a clue.

- When the player guesses the right number, display a score.

2. Rock Paper Scissors:

- The player plays against a computer opponent typing either a letter (rps) or an entire word (rock paper scissors) to play their move.

- Create a function that checks whether the move is valid or not.

- Create another function to create a computer move.

- Create another function to check who wins the round.

- Finally, create a function that keeps track of the score.

- The game should be played in a predetermined number of rounds.
