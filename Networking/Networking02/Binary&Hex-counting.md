Counting in Binary and Hex
Introduction:
You have probably already heard that a computer counts using zeros and ones. This is not technically true. 
A computer can only detect whether or not there is an electrical signal present. A signal is represented as a 1, 
the absence of electricity is represented as a 0. Because thereâ€™s only two options (0 and 1), this way of representing numbers is called binary.
One physical unit that can contain (or not contain) electricity is called a bit.

So computers work by manipulating 1s and 0s. These are binary digits, or bits for short. Single bits are too small to be much use, so they are grouped together into units of 8 bits. Each 8-bit unit is called a byte.The highest possible decimal value of a byte is 255 (1111 1111).

Counting in base 2 and base 16

Exercise :
Translate the following decimal numbers into binary:

Decimal to Binary (check where the number is in  128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)

16  

0001 0000


128 

1000 0000


228 

1110 0100


112  

0111 0000


73  

0100 1001




Translate the following binary numbers into decimal:
Binary to Decimal (Adding from left to right when you have (1) 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)

1010 1010

128 + 32 + 8 + 2 = 170

1111 0000

128+64+32+16 = 240


1101 1011

128+64+16+8+2+1 = 219

1010 0000

128+32 = 160

0011 1010

32+16+8+2 = 58


Translate the following decimal numbers into hexadecimal:

Decimal to Hex

0-9 and from 10 you count as A, B, C, D, E, F(16 digits for hex) 

--15 = F

--37

37/16 = 2,3125 --> 2 remainder 5

2,3125/16 = 0,1445 0 remainder 2
So now you read (bottom to top).
 37 = 25

--246

246/16 = 15,375 --> 15 remainder 6

15,375/16 = 0,9609 --> 0 reaminder 15

So it will be F6


--125

7D

--209

D1


Translate the following hexadecimal numbers into decimal:
Hex to Decimal

88

(8 * 16^1) + (8 * 16^0) = 128 + 8 = 136


e0

(14 * 16) + 0 = 224


cb

(12 * 16) + 11 = 203

2f

2 *16 + 15 = 47

d8

13* 16 + 8 =  216
