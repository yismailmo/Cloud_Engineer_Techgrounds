# Cron jobs
Introduction:
There might be processes that you want to execute on a regular schedule. For example, you might want to write the available disk space to a log file every hour. Or maybe you want to check for system updates every 2nd day of the month.

These kinds of jobs can be automated using Cron jobs.
## key terminolgy

Cron Jobs = to schedule a task at a specific time.
a b c d e = minute(a) hour(b) day(c) month(d) day of the week(e),  using this format to decide when the cron job will automatically run.
$crontab -1 = to display the contents of the crontab file of the currently logged in user.
$crontab -e = to edit the current user's cron jobs.


Requirements:
Your Linux machine


Exercise:


### Create a Bash script that writes the current date and time to a file in your home directory.

first step i created Bash script to show the date and time to right to "date.txt"
date > /home/ismael/time.sh/date.txt

So i tested whether i can show the date and time  by
cat date.txt





### Register the script in your crontab so that it runs every minute.
So to run the cronjab every 1 minute I Added the following cron job within crontab

first by using "crontab -e" to gain access with the following
* * * * * /home/ismael/time.sh/timing.sh
but unfortunately i did not work

### Create a script that writes available disk space to a log file in ‘/var/logs’. Use a cron job so that it runs weekly.

### Overcome challanges
Couldn't finish the second and third question even when me and my team mates even asked help from other groups.
